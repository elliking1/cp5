# Creative Project 5

For this lab, you will create a website that uses Vue for the front end and Node, Express, and Mongo for the back end. The front end should use an API to communicate with the back end, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting data stored on the back end. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be similar to the Vue apps we have already built so far. You must create your own original work. Your creative projects can build on each other.

## Requirements

This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

- The site uses Vue CLI for the front end
- The site uses Node, Express, and Mongo on the back end
- The site uses an API between the front end and back end, and supports create, read, update, and delete operations
- The site has multiple models that are linked together (e.g. cars are made by a company, books belong to a collection)
- The site has multiple pages (multiple views in the Router)
- The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
